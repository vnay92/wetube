# WeTube
A simple Video sharing website for the home (Work in [slow] progress)

## What it is supposed to do:
 - List all Movies/Series stored in the hard drive
 - Let you play all those
 - Run on a Raspberry Pi

It is basically Netflix from your hard drive, running on a Pi, so that
you and your brother/sister don't have to fight for the same external Hard Drive!

It can be extracted as an Electron Package, which can run on a Windows Desktop,
so that your Mom/Dad won't have difficulty using it.

Chaeers!
